# React Portfolio

## Description

My aim with this project was to create a portfolio based on my past projects using React. I was able to use React Router to allow the user to navigate to certain sections of the page using the URL itself. I was able to use the Routes to display each individual project card to the user. I have also created a form in the contact section to allow the user to enter their name, email and message. I have used form validation, including using RegEx, to ensure that the user enters their first name, last name and a valid email address. 


## Usage

Open the [React Portfolio](https://elenimg.github.io/react-portfolio)

Click on any of the links in the navigation bar to look at any of my projects and my contact information. Enjoy!
